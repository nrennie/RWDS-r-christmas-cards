Content briefs are an opportunity for contributors and editors to work together to evolve, refine, and agree ideas *before* a first draft is developed. This early work is valuable as it can reduce the amount of time spent on revisions and edits *after* a first draft is submitted and reviewed.

You are welcome to write and submit your content brief in whatever document format you like, using the section headings below to explain your idea. 

If you'd like to use this styled `Quarto` document template to the fullest, however, follow the notes under the first few headings and then fill in the remainder of the document. You can then render and submit the document as an html, Word, or PDF file.
