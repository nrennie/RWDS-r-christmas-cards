# Real World Data Science Template üë®üèº‚Äçüíª
Files and stylesheets to help contributors create content for [Real World Data Science](https://realworlddatascience.net/), a new data science publication from the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/).

- `content-brief.qmd` is the recommended starting point. Use this Quarto document to describe your proposed article, render and [share it](https://realworlddatascience.net/contact.html) with the Real World Data Science (RWDS) editorial board for review. 

- `report.qmd` is the place to write your draft article. The default version of this file includes a showcase of Quarto formatting options used by RWDS. Quarto is a versatile document format that facilitates the creation of beautifully formatted articles, and the inclusion of RWDS stylesheets means that rendered documents using this template will be presented in the RWDS "house style".

- `references.bib` is the place to list any references -- academic papers, books, or other works relevant to your article. This document is in BibTeX format, which is a standard format for bibliographic information. By maintaining your references in this structured format, you can easily cite them within the `report.qmd` file, and they will be automatically formatted in the specified citation style when generating the article. This ensures accurate and consistent citations in your articles.

- The **images** folder is where you should store any image and figure files. In your `report.qmd`, you can insert these files using, for example, `![figure caption](images/figure.png)`.
